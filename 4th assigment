Zadanie 1) Write program that finds max 3 salaries from the list.
salaries = [10000, 12000, 7000, 8500, 11200, 9300, 15100, 18000, 16400, 11000]
sorted_salaries = sorted (salaries, reverse = True)
top_three_salaries = sorted_salaries[:3]
print(top_three_salaries)

Zadanie 2) Write program that finds salaries greater than mean salary from dictionary.
def find_top_3_salaries(salaries):
    sorted_salaries = sorted(salaries, reverse=True)
    top_3 = sorted_salaries[:3]
    return top_3
salaries = [10000, 12000, 7000, 8500, 11200, 9300, 15100, 18000, 16400, 11000]
top_3_salaries = find_top_3_salaries(salaries)
print("Top 3 salaries:", top_3_salaries)

Zadanie 3) Write program that filters employees from ‘Management’ department and counts them.
def count_management_employees(employee_data):
    management_employees = [employee for employee, (department, _) in employee_data.items() if department == 'Management']
    num_management_employees = len(management_employees)
    return num_management_employees

employee_data = {
    "Jacek": ("Management", 50000),
    "Alicja": ("Finance", 60000),
    "Bartek": ("Management", 45000),
    "Ewa": ("Human Resources", 75000),
    "Szymon": ("Management", 80000),
    "Emilia": ("Finance", 55000),
    "Michal": ("Management", 70000)
}

num_management_employees = count_management_employees(employee_data)
print("Number of employees in the Management department:", num_management_employees)

Zadanie 4) Write program that maps employee id to first letter of name, technically means returns a dictionary, where:

-  key - an employee's id,

-  value - first letter of name

def map_id_to_first_letter(names_dict):
    id_to_first_letter = {}
    for employee_id, name in names_dict.items():
        first_letter = name[0]
        id_to_first_letter[employee_id] = first_letter
    return id_to_first_letter

employee_names = {
    1: "Jan",
    2: "Alicja",
    3: "Bartek",
    4: "Ewa",
    5: "Szymon",
    6: "Emilia",
    7: "Michal"
}

id_to_first_letter = map_id_to_first_letter(employee_names)
print("Employee ID to first letter of name mapping:")
print(id_to_first_letter)
